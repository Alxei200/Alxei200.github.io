<h1>Geometry Dash Guide</h1>

<h3>Version 2.0 - Written by Alxei200</h3>

<p>I have played this game over 1000 hours on Steam (not even including iOS gameplay time), and I feel this is the best way to finish playing this game. A complete guide.</p>

<h3>Thank you to my friends online who I have played Geometry Dash with. Here is a small list:</h3>

<p>* StaRSwiRl64 (very talented creator of levels, and is mostly underrated. Check out his levels. You will not be disappointed)</p>

<p>* suplexduplex (had a lot of fun doing demon races and 2-player challenges, even helping me verify hexagon force 2-player)</p>

<p>* beens1590 (criminally underrated. most of his levels are feature-worthy, and have less than 25 likes)</p>

<p>* REALeVi (designer of some of my levels. also helped making this faq with some of the demon analysis)</p>

<p>* Flopolopogus (very skilled player that has completed levels that i have no patience for)</p>

<p>* TrueTrinity (extremely good creator who made hot pursuit, a level analyzed in this guide)</p>

<p>* KaptainCPU (another extremely talented creator who is also amazing at the game)</p>

<h2>Menu</h2>

<h3>When you boot the game up, you should see the menu. It's a pretty simple menu, with a title, a moving background with the game's many vehicles moving from left to right, and a lot of buttons.</h3>

<h3>There are 3 main buttons that occupy the middle of the screen. The center one is the Main levels button. When you click it, it will take you to another screen where you can play the 20 main levels. These levels are covered in the Main Levels section. The arrows on the left and right select the level. If you click the text "Download the Soundtracks", a menu will pop up showing the music used in each level. The blue button in the top right displays the total amount of attempts and jumps, and your percentage of how far you have made it in the level selected. The arrow in the top left goes back to the main menu.</h3>

<h3>Back on the main menu, the button to the left of the Main levels button is the Icon Kit. Here you can change how your icon looks in-game. The text on the top of the screen that by default displays "Player" is your player name. You can change this to whatever you want! (if you don't have an account.) The circular buttons in the middle of the screen select the vehicles you want to change. From left to right, they are the Block, Ship, Ball, UFO, Dart, Robot, and Trail (the trail isn't a vehicle, it is the trail that appears behind your vehicle in-game.) If you are just starting the game, most of the icons are probably locked currently, but after you read this guide, that should change! The bottom section houses the colors. The top row is your primary color, and the bottom row is your secondary color. You can use this to make interesting color combinations. The blue button in the right shows your User ID, which the game uses to identify who you are.</h3>

<h3>Once again on the main menu, i'll go over all of the other buttons except for the one on the right side of the Main Levels button, which i'll cover last. The Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube icons go to Geometry Dash's social media. The button that says "RobTop" on it goes to robtopgames.com, GD's creator's website. The trophy button lists all of the achievements in the game, which there are 187 currently. I'll go over how to get every achievement in this guide. The gear button goes to Settings. I'll go over a lot of these options in the settings section. The button to the right of the gear is your stats. The game keeps track of a lot of things while you play Geometry Dash, including your total jumps, attempts, levels completed, and much more! This can also be used to help with getting achievements later. The rightmost button of the four bottom buttons is a button that links to newgrounds.com, where the music used in Geometry Dash comes from originally. Finally, there's the More Games button, which shows some of RobTop's other games.

<h3>Now I will go over the most extensive section of the menu, the Level Editor button. (which is right above the "More Games" button. Clicking this brings up another menu with 6 buttons. The "Create" one is the Level Editor. I go over how to use the level editor in Level Editor section. Next is the "Saved" button. This is where your saved levels exist. This is where you can view levels you've found online. The "Scores" button is where you can view the best players in the game. There are the Top 100 best players in the game, who have the most stars, coins, and demons in the game. There is a friends section where you can see how you stack up next to your friends. Global is where you stand against everyone else in the world, and finally, Creators, which hosts the Top 100 level designers in the game.</h3>

<h3>Back to the Level Editor menu, there is a button that says "Featured". This button shows the best newest levels that have been recognized by RobTop, the creator of Geometry Dash, for being very good levels. Give them a play if you feel like it. Next there is a "Map Packs" button. This is where you can find Map Packs, which are packs of levels that have been put in the game by RobTop for you to get some extra stars and coins if you complete all of the levels in a specific pack. There are currently 65 map packs in the game. The final button in this section is the "Search" button. This brings up the search interface, which allows you to find any level hosted online.</h3>

<h3>The search interface is simple, but complicated. You can simply search a level by typing it in to the searchbox, and you might find it, but the filters can help you get a select list of levels instead of searching every level. The first filters row selects difficulty, and the second selects the length of the level. The quick search buttons search a specific category that you can't replicate just by searching with filters. The button with the addition sign has even more filters for you to use, but most of those are self-explanatory.</h3>

<h3>One more button that only appears if you have a account. (if you don't have an account, this video will explain how to get one: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYG46FpI9c8) This button shows your profile. You can see your stats, friends, and messages here.</h3>

<h2>Gamemodes/Vehicles</h2>

<p>This game has 6 vehicles currently in 2.0. Here is a list of them in great detail.</p>

<h3>Block</h3>

<p>This is the standard block from The Impossible Game. It has one action: Jumping. It can jump 3 blocks in height. Most of the time it'll be jumping through spiked corridors and from pillar to pillar in this mode. This mode is affected by slopes, and you have to time jumps sometimes when you are on a slope to get the right height for the jump. The block is affected by jump pads and orbs, which do their normal functions. When the block goes through a Mini Portal, it shrinks to about half of its original size. It can jump 2 blocks in height in this size. It can make some jumps harder, but it is generally easier to go through sections with tight spaces and smaller tiles than the regular block can. The dual portal doesn't affect the normal block at all, but you do need to focus on the upside-down block as well, as sometimes the upside-down block isn't doing the same thing as the right-side up one.</p>

<h3>Ship</h3>

<p>This is the other vehicle that shipped with the game when it first released. This vehicle controls easily. When you click and hold, it flies up. When you let go, gravity takes control and it falls down. This is probably the most dynamic vehicle in the game, as it can go through so many differently styled parts. Most of the time you'll have to steadily fly through small spaces, but not always. This mode is affected by slopes, but it's very hard to get off of them once you get on one. The ship is also affected by pads and orbs, but the orbs were obviously not designed for the ship, as they are very awkward when used by the ship. When the ship goes through the mini portal, it shrinks to half its size as the block does. The ship accelerates a lot faster in this mode and can fit through small spaces easier than the regular one can. But consequently, this ship is a lot harder to control due to how fast it accelerates up and decelerates down. The dual portal can make small spaces even harder to get past since the ship inexplicably gets heavier.</p>

<h3>Ball</h3>

<p>This was the first vehicle introduced in a update. Clicking will flip the ball's gravity. It's the most simple vehicle by far. It is also probably the most inconsistent vehicle for difficulty, as it can go from easy to extremely hard very fast. The mode is affected by most objects. The mode also involved timing a lot more than the other modes. The mini portal doesn't really change how the ball works. All it really does is let the ball go into smaller spaces. Not even the gravity changes. The dual portal also doesn't affect the ball that much, but I would say that the dual ball is probably the hardest 2-player mode vehicle.</p>

<h3>UFO</h3>

<p>This is the vehicle that was stolen from Flappy Bird. My evidence for this? In the game's files the UFO is called a bird. Anyways, it controls as you might expect; click to tap.</p>
