			<p>Hi! I'm currently a high school student who likes computers, math, games, and learning! While this website is mostly used for hosting school projects, I do like to do other projects on the side. My documents page is where I leave most of my observations and guides that I create. The games section hosts all of my gaming pages. The miscellaneous page is forbidden and you should not click on that link. Ever. Finally, the contact button links to a site where you can directly contact me. Not sure why you'd have to at all, but it's there if you need it. Enjoy your time in my little corner of the web.</p>
