<h1>Spelunky Deathmatch Tourney Ruleset</h1>

<h3>This page has the default tourney ruleset and stagelist which has been reviewed by me and Kidfang.</h3>

<h2>The Ruleset</h2>
<p>Lives: 99, Bombs and Rope: 1, Wins: 5</p>

<h2>Stagelist</h2>
<h3>Mines</h3>
</center>
<p>Miner Threat: BANNED (due to the whip almost certainly killing whoever you hit, and bombs killing off everyone if thrown correctly)</p>
<p>Layer Cake: COUNTERPICK (due to bomb + whip = death, but the opposing player still has a chance.</p>
<p>Rock n’ Roll: LEGAL (due to the rock being a pivotal and deadly part of the arena, but is still dodgeable)</p>
<p>Crates: LEGAL (due to no spikes or easy quick kill spots)</p>
<p>The Dome: BANNED (due to the only safe spot being the interior of the dome, and bombs lead to easy kills)</p>
<p>Falling Rocks: LEGAL (due to the rocks having little effect on the game)</p>
<p>The Spider Pit: COUNTERPICK (due to the spiders being pretty unfair, but the opposing player still has a chance)</p>
<p>Ladders: LEGAL (due to it being a simple neutral arena with no unfair easy deaths)</p>
<center>
<h3>Jungle</h3>
</center>
<p>Tiki Terror: COUNTERPICK (due to it being somewhat unfair with level generation, but it is sometimes fair.</p>
<p>Treehouses: BANNED (due to bombs killing off the trees extremely quick.</p>
<p>Vines: LEGAL (due to it being generally neutral)</p>
<p>Fortress: COUNTERPICK (due to it being easy to get stuck when bombs are placed outside of the fortress)</p>
<p>Dunk Tank: BANNED (due to it being too easy to get infinites)</p>
<p>Tarzan: BANNED (due to it being too similar to Miner Threat)</p>
<p>Kudzu: BANNED (due to the tiki towers and spikes)</p>
<p>The Hill: LEGAL (due to a pretty neutral start, and good for doubles and 4-player)</p>
<center>
<h3>Ice</h3>
</center>
<p>Ice Temple: COUNTERPICK (due to general chaos)</p>
<p>Moonbounce: BANNED (due to easy item infinites)</p>
<p>Don’t Fall!: BANNED (due to whips being OP)</p>
<p>The Calm: LEGAL (due to spikes being relatively difficult to get to without effort)</p>
<p>Deathbounce: BANNED (due to easy item infinites + spikes)</p>
<p>Frosted: COUNTERPICK (due to chaos, but you still have good control over space)</p>
<p>Cold Cage: LEGAL (due to it being a neutral and tactical stage)</p>
<p>Do Fall: BANNED (due to really easy kills once you get to the top)</p>
<center>
<h3>Temple</h3>
</center>
<p>Trap Temple: LEGAL (due to it being a tactical and hard stage)</p>
<p>Fire Pit: BANNED (due to whips being OP)</p>
<p>Rooms: COUNTERPICK (due to whips being OP, but running away is still an option)</p>
<p>Deathbox: COUNTERPICK (due to bombs being OP, but there is only really 4 bombs)</p>
<p>Pressure: BANNED (due to general chaos)</p>
<p>Crushers: BANNED (due to general chaos)</p>
